# A2UI / a2tea Communication Guide

Crush renders rich, interactive terminal UI from **A2UI** (the [A2UI protocol](https://a2ui.org), via the a2tea bridge). A surface is a compact visual — a status card, an option list, a progress readout, a short form. Most replies should stay prose; reach for a surface only when the structure genuinely helps.

## Two delivery paths — pick the right one

There are two ways an A2UI surface reaches the user. **Prefer reading an MCP resource when the data lives on a server**; emit inline JSON only for ad-hoc visuals no server provides.

### 1. Read an MCP `/a2ui` resource (preferred for server data)

Servers that own data (a todo queue, a bundle, a trace, a dashboard) expose **A2UI resource templates** — URIs ending in `/a2ui` — that render their data as a surface. Read one with `read_mcp_resource`:

```
read_mcp_resource(mcp_name="todos", uri="todos://queue/<name>/a2ui")
```

What happens:
- The host renders the surface for the **user** (audience `user`) and hands **you** a one-line placeholder, e.g. `[A2UI surface rendered in the chat UI from todos://queue/<name>/a2ui — the user can already see it; do not repeat or echo its JSON payload]`.
- You do **not** receive the surface JSON. **Never re-echo, re-emit, or paraphrase the surface** — the user can already see it. Continue in prose.
- Resource templates are listed by `list_mcp_resources`. A template with `{id}` is filled by you (e.g. `.../artifact/<id>/a2ui`); one with `{?w}` accepts an optional width hint the host manages — **do not** append `?w=` yourself.

Use this path whenever a server offers an `/a2ui` view of its data. It is richer (server-rendered, sized to the host) and cheaper (no JSON through your context) than reconstructing the same view inline.

### 2. Emit your own inline surface (ad-hoc visuals)

For a visual no server provides, embed a single inline `<a2ui-json>{...}</a2ui-json>` block containing one `updateComponents` message:

```json
<a2ui-json>{
  "version": "v0.9",
  "updateComponents": {
    "surfaceId": "s1",
    "components": [
      {"component": "Card", "id": "root", "child": "col"},
      {"component": "Column", "id": "col", "children": ["title", "body", "btn-ok"]},
      {"component": "Text", "id": "title", "variant": "h2", "text": "Build passed"},
      {"component": "Text", "id": "body", "text": "142 tests, 0 failures."},
      {"component": "Button", "id": "btn-ok", "child": "btn-ok-label"},
      {"component": "Text", "id": "btn-ok-label", "text": "Acknowledge"}
    ]
  }
}</a2ui-json>
```

This is the **chat-scanned** path: the surface is part of your reply. Use it for summaries, dashboards, and one-shot forms you author yourself.

## Component architecture

Components live in a **flat adjacency list** and reference children by `id`. The renderer resolves the tree from the root (the component nothing else references as a child).

### Core catalog (fully supported)

- `Text`: text display. Fields: `text` (string), `variant` (`h1`–`h5`, `caption`; omit for body).
- `Card`: rounded-border container. Single `child` id.
- `Column`: lays out `children` (array of ids) vertically.
- `Row`: lays out `children` horizontally.
- `List`: lays out `children` as a list (divider between rows).
- `Divider`: a horizontal rule.
- `Button`: focusable button. Its label is a single `child` id pointing at a `Text` component — there is **no** `label`/`text` field on `Button`. On press, the surface's current field values come back to you; a button whose id reads as cancel (`btn-cancel`, `dismiss`, `close`) just dismisses the form.

### Input components (editable)

Render their current value; the user can edit; values (keyed by component `id`) return when a button on the surface is pressed:
- `TextField`, `CheckBox`, `ChoicePicker`, `Slider`, `DateTimeInput`

### Media & layout placeholders

- `Image`, `Icon`, `Video`, `AudioPlayer`: compact one-line placeholders.
- `Tabs`: renders the title bar and only the *first* tab's content.
- `Modal`: renders only its trigger; content stays hidden.

## Forms (the submission loop)

A form is a surface with input components plus a `Button`. When the user presses the button you receive a message naming the button and carrying the field values keyed by component `id`. A cancel-reading button dismisses without a submission.

**Complete form template — copy this shape.** Two inputs, two buttons; each button gets its own child `Text` label:

```json
<a2ui-json>{
  "version": "v0.9",
  "updateComponents": {
    "surfaceId": "form",
    "components": [
      {"component": "Card", "id": "root", "child": "col"},
      {"component": "Column", "id": "col", "children": ["name", "email", "actions"]},
      {"component": "TextField", "id": "name", "label": "Name"},
      {"component": "TextField", "id": "email", "label": "Email"},
      {"component": "Row", "id": "actions", "children": ["btn-send", "btn-cancel"]},
      {"component": "Button", "id": "btn-send", "child": "btn-send-label"},
      {"component": "Text", "id": "btn-send-label", "text": "Send"},
      {"component": "Button", "id": "btn-cancel", "child": "btn-cancel-label"},
      {"component": "Text", "id": "btn-cancel-label", "text": "Cancel"}
    ]
  }
}</a2ui-json>
```

## A2UI over MCP (the contract)

When you build or reason about server-side surfaces, the A2UI-over-MCP contract (https://a2ui.org/guides/a2ui_over_mcp/) governs:

- **MIME type** `application/a2ui+json` (legacy `application/json+a2ui`) identifies a surface, delivered by `resources/read` (an `/a2ui` resource) or by a `tools/call` result carrying an `EmbeddedResource` of that type.
- **Audience**: a surface annotated `["user"]` renders for the human and its raw JSON is kept out of your context; `["assistant"]` is for your reasoning and is not rendered; empty means both.
- **Interactivity round-trip**: a surface's `Button` carries an `action` = `{event: {name, context}}`. When the user clicks, the host calls the owning server's `a2ui_action` tool with `{name, context}` (data bindings resolved against surface state) and feeds any returned A2UI payload back into the **same** surface — no agent turn. Render failures go back via an `a2ui_error` tool call.
- **Width hint**: a server may size pre-rendered geometry (e.g. a flame graph) to an optional `?w=N` hint the **host** appends. Never add `?w=` yourself; only templates declaring `{?w}` accept it.

You normally only *consume* server surfaces (path 1). Build them only when you are authoring an MCP server.

## Best practices

1. **Keep it compact.** Surfaces are concise summaries, controls, or dashboards. Use fenced code blocks for code or long logs.
2. **One surface per block.** All components inside the `components` array of a single `updateComponents` message.
3. **Link correctly.** Every `child`/`children` id must exist in your array — a dangling id renders `[a2tea: missing component ...]`.
4. **Mix with Markdown.** Prose before and after the `<a2ui-json>` block is fine.
5. **Don't re-emit server surfaces.** If you read an `/a2ui` resource, the user already sees it — move on in prose.

## Common mistakes (anti-patterns)

### Buttons do NOT have a `text` or `label` field

**NEVER put `text`/`label` on a `Button`** — the spec has no such field; the label comes only from a child `Text`. A stray key is dropped and the button renders unlabeled.

**Wrong — the label will be empty:**
```json
{"component": "Button", "id": "btn", "text": "Submit"}
```

**Correct — a child Text component:**
```json
{"component": "Button", "id": "btn", "child": "btn-label"},
{"component": "Text", "id": "btn-label", "text": "Submit"}
```

### Every `child` / `children` id must exist

**Wrong — dangling reference:**
```json
{"component": "Card", "id": "root", "child": "missing-id"}
```
No component `missing-id` exists, so the card renders `[a2tea: missing component "missing-id"]`. Always include a matching component for every referenced id.

### Do not nest components inline

Components are a **flat list**; `child` is a **string id**, not an object.

**Wrong — inline nesting:**
```json
{"component": "Card", "id": "root", "child": {"component": "Text", "text": "Hello"}}
```

**Correct — define separately, link by id:**
```json
{"component": "Card", "id": "root", "child": "body"},
{"component": "Text", "id": "body", "text": "Hello"}
```

### Do not put code in a surface

A2UI surfaces are for compact visual structure. Use fenced code blocks (`` ``` ``) for code, command output, or logs — a `Text` component will not syntax-highlight.
