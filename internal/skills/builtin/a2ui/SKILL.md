# A2UI / a2tea Communication Guide

Crush supports rendering rich, interactive terminal UI components embedded directly in your markdown responses using **a2tea** (a bridge to the [A2UI](https://a2ui.org) protocol).

You can emit an A2UI surface when a compact visual genuinely helps — such as a status card, an option list, a progress readout, or a form. Most of your replies should remain prose, but when a visual structure adds value, use A2UI.

## Wire Format

Embed a single inline `<a2ui-json>{...}</a2ui-json>` block in your response. Inside, provide an A2UI v0.9 payload containing an `updateComponents` message.

### Example Payload

```json
<a2ui-json>{
  "version": "v0.9",
  "updateComponents": {
    "surfaceId": "s1",
    "components": [
      {
        "component": "Card",
        "id": "root",
        "child": "col"
      },
      {
        "component": "Column",
        "id": "col",
        "children": ["title", "body", "btn-ok"]
      },
      {
        "component": "Text",
        "id": "title",
        "variant": "h2",
        "text": "Build passed"
      },
      {
        "component": "Text",
        "id": "body",
        "text": "142 tests, 0 failures."
      },
      {
        "component": "Button",
        "id": "btn-ok",
        "child": "btn-ok-label"
      },
      {
        "component": "Text",
        "id": "btn-ok-label",
        "text": "Acknowledge"
      }
    ]
  }
}</a2ui-json>
```

## Component Architecture

A2UI components live in a flat list (adjacency list) and reference their children by `id`. The renderer resolves the tree from the root (the component that nothing else references as a child).

### Core Catalog (Fully Supported)

These components render beautifully with full styling and layout:
- `Text`: Text display. Options: `text` (string), `variant` (h1-h5, caption).
- `Card`: A rounded border container. Expects a single `child` ID.
- `Column`: Lays out children vertically. Expects a `children` array of IDs.
- `Row`: Lays out children horizontally. Expects a `children` array of IDs.
- `List`: Lays out children as a list. Expects a `children` array of IDs.
- `Divider`: A horizontal rule.
- `Button`: Focusable button. Its label comes from a single `child` ID pointing at a `Text` component (there is no `label` field). Pressing Enter emits a click event to the host.

### Input Components (Read-Only Visuals)

These components will render their current values, but currently do not allow the user to interactively edit them or send input back to the agent:
- `TextField`
- `CheckBox`
- `ChoicePicker`
- `Slider`
- `DateTimeInput`

### Media & Layout Placeholders

- `Image`, `Icon`, `Video`, `AudioPlayer`: Render as compact one-line placeholders.
- `Tabs`: Render the title bar and only the *first* tab's content.
- `Modal`: Renders only its trigger, content stays hidden.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it compact:** A2UI surfaces should be concise summaries, controls, or dashboards. Use standard markdown fences for code or long logs.
2. **One surface per block:** Provide all components inside the `components` array of a single `updateComponents` message.
3. **Link correctly:** Ensure every ID in `child` or `children` corresponds to a component in your array. Dangling IDs will break the render.
4. **Mix with Markdown:** You can put markdown text before and after the `<a2ui-json>` block.
